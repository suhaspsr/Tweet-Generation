“Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump” @FoxNews  Of course not because there is none and never was. This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia!,2/24/2018 23:44,9.68E+17
Dem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow!,2/24/2018 23:20,9.68E+17
The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. SO ILLEGAL!,2/24/2018 23:16,9.68E+17
BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS: 93% APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you!). 50% say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny!). 79% say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen).,2/24/2018 22:26,9.68E+17
Dems are no longer talking DACA! “Out of sight out of mind” they say. DACA beneficiaries should not be happy. Nancy Pelosi truly doesn’t care about them. Republicans stand ready to make a deal!,2/24/2018 21:18,9.68E+17
Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations!,2/24/2018 21:07,9.68E+17
Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania. @FoxNews. This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole. Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP!,2/24/2018 20:16,9.67E+17
Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept &amp; have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again - a big &amp; very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States.,2/24/2018 18:54,9.67E+17

MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands but these killers come back in from El Salvador and through Mexico like water. El Salvador just takes our money and Mexico must help MORE with this problem. We need The Wall!,2/23/2018 11:28,9.67E+17
“School shooting survivor says he quit @CNN Town Hall after refusing scripted question.” @TuckerCarlson. Just like so much of CNN Fake News. That’s why their ratings are so bad! MSNBC may be worse.,2/23/2018 1:26,9.67E+17
Today it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the @WhiteHouse with State and local leaders law enforcement officers and education officials.There is nothing more important than protecting our children.

What many people don’t understand or don’t want to understand is that Wayne Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing.                  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,2/22/2018 14:31,9.67E+17
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!,2/22/2018 13:13,9.67E+17
....If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive defense alone won’t work!,2/22/2018 13:05,9.67E+17
....History shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes. It takes police &amp; first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!,2/22/2018 12:54,9.67E+17
....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!,2/22/2018 12:40,9.67E+17
I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN &amp; @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers a lot would now be able to,2/22/2018 12:26,9.67E+17

Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!,2/21/2018 14:40,9.66E+17
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.,2/21/2018 14:22,9.66E+17

So true thank you! https://t.co/9TTXlfokYz,2/21/2018 1:14,9.66E+17
Bad ratings @CNN &amp; @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise!,2/21/2018 1:08,9.66E+17

....cameras running. Another False Accusation. Why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off. Only @FoxNews so reported...doesn’t fit the Mainstream Media narrative.,2/20/2018 15:29,9.66E+17
A woman I don’t know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security......,2/20/2018 15:16,9.66E+17
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts. Total Fake News!,2/20/2018 13:38,9.66E+17
Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don’t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money!,2/20/2018 13:11,9.66E+17
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. You’ve come a long way Matt!,2/20/2018 13:03,9.66E+17
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially. Also they want to do nothing on DACA R’s want to fix!,2/20/2018 12:54,9.66E+17
....The President Obama quote just before election. That’s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.,2/20/2018 12:46,9.66E+17
“There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so I’d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.” .....,2/20/2018 12:37,9.66E+17
Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!,2/20/2018 12:24,9.66E+17

Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. But wasn’t I a great candidate?,2/18/2018 12:43,9.65E+17
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said “it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!,2/18/2018 12:33,9.65E+17
Finally Liddle’ Adam Schiff the leakin’ monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing. Thank you Adam!,2/18/2018 12:22,9.65E+17
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!,2/18/2018 12:02,9.65E+17
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company!,2/18/2018 4:22,9.65E+17
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!,2/18/2018 4:08,9.65E+17
Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp; Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to and now they just talk!,2/17/2018 23:45,9.65E+17

Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know!,2/17/2018 19:46,9.65E+17
Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: “There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity.

“Charges Deal Don A Big Win” written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost succinctly states that “the Russians had no impact on the election results.” There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. “She lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.”,2/17/2018 19:26,9.65E+17

So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again!,2/15/2018 12:12,9.64E+17

Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.,7/26/2016 12:42,7.58E+17
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great,7/26/2016 12:38,7.58E+17
Funny if you listen to @FoxNews the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two they are fawning. What a difference,7/26/2016 12:34,7.58E+17
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.,7/26/2016 3:19,7.58E+17
Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated!,7/26/2016 3:12,7.58E+17
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.,7/26/2016 3:04,7.58E+17
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.,7/26/2016 2:14,7.58E+17
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!,7/25/2016 21:57,7.58E+17
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!,7/25/2016 21:45,7.58E+17
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.,7/25/2016 21:33,7.58E+17
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War.,7/25/2016 21:32,7.58E+17

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA,7/25/2016 14:05,7.58E+17
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!,7/25/2016 14:01,7.58E+17
Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!,7/25/2016 13:47,7.58E+17
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!,7/25/2016 13:42,7.58E+17
"Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie.",7/25/2016 13:19,7.58E+17
If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.,7/25/2016 12:27,7.58E+17
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam,7/25/2016 12:26,7.58E+17
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!,7/25/2016 12:02,7.58E+17
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!,7/25/2016 11:57,7.58E+17
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes me,7/25/2016 11:31,7.58E+17
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!,7/24/2016 23:59,7.57E+17
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!,7/24/2016 23:47,7.57E+17
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she's out!,7/24/2016 22:33,7.57E+17
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!,7/24/2016 22:16,7.57E+17
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!,7/24/2016 22:07,7.57E+17
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out,7/24/2016 22:02,7.57E+17
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wild,7/24/2016 21:53,7.57E+17
The @CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!,7/24/2016 20:45,7.57E+17
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!,7/24/2016 20:30,7.57E+17
Today proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.),7/24/2016 20:20,7.57E+17
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!,7/24/2016 13:30,7.57E+17
"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!",7/24/2016 13:27,7.57E+17
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.,7/24/2016 12:30,7.57E+17
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!,7/24/2016 12:15,7.57E+17
Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!,7/24/2016 11:56,7.57E+17
Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT,7/24/2016 11:25,7.57E+17
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!,7/24/2016 11:16,7.57E+17
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain#TrumpPence16 https://t.co/gCzHX1nyxD,7/24/2016 0:38,7.57E+17
@NancyNielsenn: @realDonaldTrump Dinesh D'Sousa Hillary's America. see it,7/23/2016 22:13,7.57E+17
@OliMauritania: @realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals https://t.co/0FFeKTsuJn #HillaryKaine2016,7/23/2016 22:11,7.57E+17
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!,7/23/2016 22:05,7.57E+17
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!,7/23/2016 21:20,7.57E+17
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!,7/23/2016 20:43,7.57E+17
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!,7/23/2016 16:06,7.57E+17
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!,7/23/2016 15:36,7.57E+17
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!,7/23/2016 15:01,7.57E+17
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.,7/23/2016 14:51,7.57E+17
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED,7/23/2016 10:55,7.57E+17
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!,7/23/2016 10:42,7.57E+17
Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!,7/23/2016 10:35,7.57E+17
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?,7/23/2016 10:31,7.57E+17
@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain,7/23/2016 3:56,7.57E+17
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.,7/23/2016 3:49,7.57E+17
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?,7/23/2016 3:23,7.57E+17
Another attack this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.,7/22/2016 23:03,7.57E+17
One of the best produced including the incredible stage &amp; set in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove,7/22/2016 14:06,7.56E+17
Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!,7/22/2016 13:13,7.56E+17

STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECHhttps://t.co/uzBOm21Pug,7/20/2016 17:02,7.56E+17
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.,7/20/2016 15:36,7.56E+17
Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!,7/20/2016 15:31,7.56E+17
In November I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!,7/20/2016 12:51,7.56E+17

.@Omarosa is not winning points being called “the wicked witch of the Mid-West” and most certainly other things. #CelebApprentice,3/18/2013 1:44,3.13E+17
.@Omarosa’s new name via @DennisRodman: “Ms. Saboteur” sounds rather elegant. #CelebApprentice,3/18/2013 1:39,3.13E+17

A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.  The onus is on Obama to first release his records.,10/31/2012 20:53,2.64E+17
President Obama if it is important to you I will substantially increase the $5M offer!,10/31/2012 20:46,2.64E+17
